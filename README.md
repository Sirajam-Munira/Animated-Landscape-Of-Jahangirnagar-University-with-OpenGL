## Project Description

The "Scenic Animated Landscape" project is a captivating computer graphics program developed using C++, OpenGL, and GLUT libraries. It is designed to depict a picturesque and dynamic outdoor scene, featuring various elements that come together to create a visually engaging and interactive landscape.

### Technologies and Libraries Used

- **C++:** The programming language used for project development.
- **OpenGL:** A graphics library for rendering 2D and 3D graphics.
- **GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit):** A library for window management and user input in OpenGL applications.
- **MMSystem:** A Windows multimedia library used for playing background music (WAV file).


### Key Features

1. **Dynamic Sky:** The program showcases a stunning sky with a moving sun, providing a realistic day-to-night transition effect.

2. **Landscape Elements:** The landscape includes lush green fields, a winding road, and a prominent stage, contributing to the overall scenic beauty.

3. **Trees:** Multiple trees with leaves and trunks add a natural and aesthetic touch to the environment.

4. **Cloud Animation:** Animated clouds gracefully move across the sky, enhancing the realism and dynamism of the scene.

5. **Bird Animation:** Colorful animated birds soar across the screen, injecting life and vibrancy into the landscape.

6. **Musical Accompaniment:** The program plays background music (loaded from a specified WAV file), creating an immersive auditory experience.

7. **Continuous Loop:** Various animation elements, such as the clouds, birds, and the sun, operate in a continuous loop, ensuring an uninterrupted and dynamic landscape.

8. **Interactivity:** The project can be interacted with using keyboard inputs, allowing users to engage with the animation.

### Usage

To run the project and experience this scenic landscape, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies (OpenGL, GLUT) installed.

2. Compile the project using a C++ compiler, making sure to link the required libraries.

3. Run the compiled executable.

4. Enjoy the animated landscape and interact with it using keyboard inputs as specified in the program.

**Note:** The project's background music is loaded from a WAV file specified in the code.
